## What incomplete or left over from yesterday (May 9) you have
-  individual git workflow document(i01)

## Rate myself for May 9 on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 being bad and 4 being excellent)
Rating: 3
We couldn't complete the individual git workflow document because we had a huge mistake at the very last step(We accidentally merged main branch into dev branch which must be opposite). However, we could still learn a lot from the mistake, so I would rate myself at 3.
